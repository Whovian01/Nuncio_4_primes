One of the things I noticed that was similar between the two was the jump 
statements, as well as the conditional jump statements. For example, both 
assembly and HRM have a normal jump statement, a jump if zero statement, and a
jump if negative statement. 

Like mentioned above, both assembly and HRM have jump statements. However, 
assembly seems to have a much wider range of jump statements, such as jump 
greater, jump less, jump equal, jump if overflow, jump no sign, and many more 
statements that you cannot get in HRM.
